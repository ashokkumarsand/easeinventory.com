### 2. Forbidden Phrases vs. Recommended Phrases

### 3. Messaging Pillars

## Technical Instructions for AI Agents (Agent MD)

1. **Precision Rule:** All UI labels and copy should sound "Visionary yet Disciplined." Avoid "marketing fluff"; use "Technical Authority."
2. **Action-Oriented:** Buttons should not just say "Submit" or "Click Here." They should use movement terms: "Mobilize," "Deploy," "Launch," "Capture."
3. **Legal Guardrails:** Always ensure the "Antigravity" branding is associated with the product's performance (speed/efficiency). Avoid claims about literal levitation in product descriptions.
