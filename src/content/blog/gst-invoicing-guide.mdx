# GST Invoicing Best Practices for Small Businesses

Getting GST invoicing right is crucial for compliance and claiming Input Tax Credit (ITC). Here's everything you need to know.

## Mandatory Fields on a GST Invoice

Every GST invoice must contain:

- **Invoice Number**: Unique, sequential, max 16 characters
- **Invoice Date**: Date of issue
- **Supplier Details**: Name, address, GSTIN
- **Recipient Details**: Name, address, GSTIN (if registered)
- **HSN/SAC Code**: For goods/services classification
- **Tax Breakdown**: CGST, SGST, or IGST rates

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Incorrect GSTIN

Always verify customer GSTIN before invoicing. A single digit error can cause ITC rejection.

> In EaseInventory, we auto-validate GSTIN against the government database.

### 2. Missing HSN Codes

From April 2024, HSN codes are mandatory:
- **4 digits**: Turnover up to ₹5 crore
- **6 digits**: Turnover above ₹5 crore

### 3. Place of Supply Errors

For inter-state supplies, apply **IGST**. For intra-state, apply **CGST + SGST**.

## Invoice Series Best Practices

Use a clear naming convention:

```
[Location]-[Financial Year]-[Sequence]
Example: MUM-2526-00001
```

This helps in:
- Easy tracking and audit
- Location-based reporting
- Compliance documentation

## Digital Invoice Benefits

Electronic invoicing saves:

- **Paper costs** by 80%
