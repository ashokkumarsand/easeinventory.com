# Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization

If you manage inventory across multiple warehouses, stores, or fulfillment centers, you already know the headache: one location drowning in excess stock while another runs dangerously low. Multi-echelon inventory optimization solves this problem at its root.

## What is Multi-Echelon Inventory?

Traditional inventory management treats each warehouse as an isolated silo. You set reorder points per location, and each place fends for itself.

**Multi-echelon** takes a network-wide view. Instead of optimizing each location in isolation, it analyzes demand patterns, stock levels, and lead times across your entire warehouse hierarchy — from central distribution centers down to retail points — and calculates the optimal stock placement for the whole network.

The result? Lower total inventory, fewer stockouts, and dramatically reduced carrying costs.

## The Problem with Manual Stock Transfers

Most businesses rely on gut instinct or spreadsheets to decide when to move stock between locations. This leads to:

- **Reactive transfers** — stock moves only after a stockout has already happened
- **Excess carrying costs** — safety stock piled up "just in case" at every location
- **Imbalanced service levels** — some customers get next-day delivery, others wait a week
- **Wasted transport** — emergency shipments cost 3-5x more than planned transfers

For businesses operating across 3+ locations, these inefficiencies can eat 15-25% of inventory carrying costs.

## How EaseInventory Solves It

EaseInventory's Multi-Echelon Optimization engine continuously analyzes your network and provides actionable intelligence.

### Real-Time Network Analysis

The system ingests sales order data, current stock levels, and location capacity to compute:

- **Echelon base-stock levels** — the mathematically optimal stock at each tier
- **Service level by location** — are your customers being served equally?
- **Network imbalance scores** — a single number showing how unevenly stock is distributed

### Smart Alerts

The alerts engine monitors three critical conditions:

1. **Low Stock Alerts** (red) — locations where service level drops below 50%, meaning you are likely to stockout before replenishment arrives
2. **Overstock Alerts** (blue) — locations holding more than 200% of optimal stock, tying up working capital unnecessarily
3. **Imbalance Alerts** (amber) — SKUs where stock distribution across the network deviates more than 30% from optimal

Each alert includes the specific product, location, current vs. optimal quantities, and a one-click action to create a transfer.

### One-Click Rebalancing

When the system detects an imbalance, it generates specific transfer recommendations:

- Which product to move
- From which location (excess)
- To which location (deficit)
- Exact quantity

Click "Create Transfer" and it flows directly into your transshipment workflow — no manual calculations needed.

### Scheduled Monitoring

Set up automated monitoring that runs daily, weekly, or monthly. Configure your thresholds:

- Minimum service level before an alert triggers
- Maximum acceptable network imbalance percentage

The system will automatically flag issues before they impact your customers.
